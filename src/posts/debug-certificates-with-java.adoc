== Intro

While dealing with https communication in Java applications you might face the following error:

[source,bash]
----
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target; nested exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException
----

While this error might happen for a number of reasons, here I'll describe the ones I've faced most often along with methods and tools that are helpful during debugging.

Please note that this post is not intended to have a general discussion about SSL Certificates and does not try to cover all sorts of problems you might face with them. It's just a good starting point with some suggestions, so you could poke around and hopefully find out the case of your issue easily.

== Invalid certificate chain

Firstly, not all issues might be coming from your side. Sometimes it's a sever configuration that is faulty. One of such server configuration issues is - invalid certificate chain. It happens when a server only provides it's certificate without intermediate one, that links the server certificate with a Root CA added to the trust store. While most modern browsers handle this problem by fetching intermediate certificates themselves, Java doesn't.

In order to check whether some server has a valid certificate chain you can use https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?] . It also completes the chain if it's invalid and allows to download valid public certificate.

=== Checking chain with command line tools

In case you can't check a server certificate with https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?] (because it's not available from the internet for example), you can use the powerful command line tool called https://www.openssl.org/[opnessl].

Just run:

[source,bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 -servername google.com
CONNECTED(00000006)
depth=2 OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = Google Trust Services, CN = GTS CA 1O1
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Mountain View, O = Google LLC, CN = *.google.com
verify return:1
---
Certificate chain
 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google LLC/CN=*.google.com
   i:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
 1 s:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
   i:/OU=GlobalSign Root CA - R2/O=GlobalSign/CN=GlobalSign
---
----

And check `Certificate chain` part. It should go up till the Root CA.

In case it's not - you have two options: either contact service responsible and ask him to fix the certificate chain, or add intermediate CA to the trust store.
