== Intro

While dealing with https communication in Java applications you might face the following error:

[source,bash]
----
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target; nested exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException
----

While this error might happen for a number of reasons, here I'll describe the ones I've faced most often along with methods and tools that are helpful during debugging.

[NOTE]

Please note that this post is not intended to have a general discussion about SSL Certificates and does not try to cover all sorts of problems you might face with them. It's just a good starting point with some suggestions, so you could poke around and hopefully find out the case of your issue easily.

== Invalid certificate chain

Firstly, not all issues might be coming from your side. Sometimes it's a sever configuration that is faulty. One of such server configuration issues is - invalid certificate chain. It happens when a server only provides it's certificate without intermediate one, that links the server certificate with a Root CA added to the trust store. While most modern browsers handle this problem by fetching intermediate certificates themselves, Java doesn't.

In order to check whether some server has a valid certificate chain you can use https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?] . It also completes the chain if it's invalid and allows to download valid public certificate.

=== Checking chain with command line tools

In case you can't check a server certificate with https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?] (because it's not available from the internet for example), you can use the powerful command line tool called https://www.openssl.org/[opnessl].

Just run:

[source,bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 -servername google.com

CONNECTED(00000006)
depth=2 OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = Google Trust Services, CN = GTS CA 1O1
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Mountain View, O = Google LLC, CN = *.google.com
verify return:1
---
Certificate chain
 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google LLC/CN=*.google.com
   i:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
 1 s:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
   i:/OU=GlobalSign Root CA - R2/O=GlobalSign/CN=GlobalSign
---
----

And check `Certificate chain` part. It should go up till the Root CA.

In case it's not - you have two options: either contact service responsible and ask him to fix the certificate chain, or add intermediate CA to the trust store.

== Adding certificate to the trust store

Sometimes service you need to consume might use self-signed certificates, or certificates that are signed by some CA that is not trusted by Java (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34110426/does-java-support-lets-encrypt-certificates[e.g. older versions of Java do not trust Let's Encrypt certificates]).

You can check the list of the trusted certificate issuers by running:

[source,bash]
----
keytool -list -cacerts -storepass changeit

Keystore type: JKS
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 137 entries

`openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20` yields 137 entries.

== Verifying Java trust store

In order to verify that you have your trust store configured as expected - you need to issues a test request to a service via secure connection. While you could simply spin up you application and see, it's not always convenient or safe.

A better approach would be to spin up a small utility with the same set of JVM options and verify the connection only. I'll use https://github.com/commandercool/ssl-check[ssl-check]. It simply creates a secure socket and initializes SSL Handshake process with a specified host.

In order to run it - go to the machine where you have Java trust store configured or get an interactive shell inside a container that is going to run your application, download and compile https://github.com/commandercool/ssl-check[ssl-check]:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commandercool/ssl-check/master/src/SSLCheck.java
javac SSLCheck.java
----

Now start it, providing host info:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp . SSLCheck google.com 443

About to connect to 'google.com' on port 443
Successfully connected
----

In case everything is configured right - you should see `Successfully connected` message. This means that you are set and good to go with your application!
