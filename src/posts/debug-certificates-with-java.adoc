== Intro

While dealing with https communication in Java applications you might face the following error:

[source,bash]
----
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target; nested exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException
----

While this error might happen for a number of reasons, here I'll describe the ones I've faced most often along with methods and tools that are helpful during debugging.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that this post is not intended to have a general discussion about SSL Certificates and does not try to cover all sorts of problems you might face with them. It's just a good starting point with some suggestions, so you could poke around and hopefully find out the cause of your issue easily.

== Invalid certificate chain

Firstly, not all issues might be coming from your side. Sometimes it's a sever configuration that is faulty. One of such server configuration issues is invalid certificate chain. It happens when a server only provides it's certificate without intermediate one, that links the server certificate with a Root CA added to the truststore. While most modern browsers handle this problem by fetching intermediate certificates themselves, Java doesn't.

[NOTE]
====
Truststore in Java is a file that contains root certificates for Certificate Authorities that Java trusts. Meaning that for Java client to trust a resource - it's certificate should be signed with one of the authorities from the truststore.

In order to check whether some server has a valid certificate chain you can use https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?]

It also completes the chain if it's invalid and allows to download a valid public certificate.

=== Checking chain with command line tools

In case you can't check a server certificate with https://whatsmychaincert.com/[What's My Chain Cert?] (because it's not accessible from the internet for example), you can use the powerful command line tool called https://www.openssl.org/[opnessl].

Just run:

[source,bash]
----
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 -servername google.com

CONNECTED(00000006)
depth=2 OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = Google Trust Services, CN = GTS CA 1O1
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Mountain View, O = Google LLC, CN = *.google.com
verify return:1
---
Certificate chain
 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google LLC/CN=*.google.com
   i:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
 1 s:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=GTS CA 1O1
   i:/OU=GlobalSign Root CA - R2/O=GlobalSign/CN=GlobalSign
---
----

And check `Certificate chain` part. It should go up till the Root CA (which is GlobalSign in this example).

In case it's not - you have two options: either contact service responsible and ask him to fix the certificate chain, or add intermediate CA to the trust store.

== Adding a certificate to the trust store

When either service provides an invalid certificate chain or uses self-signed certificates, or simply certificates that are signed by some CA that is not trusted by Java (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34110426/does-java-support-lets-encrypt-certificates[e.g. older versions of Java do not trust Let's Encrypt certificates]), you'll need to add this certificate to the truststore manually.

To do so you first need to download the certificate:

[source,bash]
----
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 \
    | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > server.crt
----

This one-liner uses the same `openssl` command that was shown before, but with https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html[sed] piped with it to grab only the certificate part from the output.

Once you got a certificate you need to import it into the Java trust store:

[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -cacerts -alias server -file server.crt -storepass changeit -noprompt

Certificate was added to keystore
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note the password after `-storepass` parameter. `changeit` is the default value.
====

== Verifying Java trust store

You can check the list of the trusted certificate issuers by running the following command and verifying that it contains the one that you've added:

[source,bash]
----
keytool -list -cacerts -storepass changeit

Keystore type: JKS
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 137 entries

Even a better way of verification - is to issue a test request to a service via secure connection. While you could simply spin up you application and see, it's not always convenient or safe.

A better approach would be to spin up a small utility with the same set of JVM options and verify the connection only. I'll use https://github.com/commandercool/ssl-check[ssl-check]. It simply creates a secure socket and initializes SSL Handshake process with a specified host.

In order to run it - go to the machine where you have Java truststore configured or get an interactive shell inside a container that is going to run your application, download and compile https://github.com/commandercool/ssl-check[ssl-check]:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commandercool/ssl-check/master/src/SSLCheck.java
javac SSLCheck.java
----

Now start it, providing host info:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp . SSLCheck google.com 443

About to connect to 'google.com' on port 443
Successfully connected
----

In case everything is configured right - you should see `Successfully connected` message. This means that you are set and good to go with your application!
